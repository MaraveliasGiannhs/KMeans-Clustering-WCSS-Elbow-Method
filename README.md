# KMeans Clustering and WCSS Elbow Method
The purpose of this project is to simulate data collection via randomly generating numbers, then use that data as a dataset for KMeans algorithm and then use that data again for WCSS algorithm. 
After running the program, three things will show up:

1. A windows console showing the values (location) of each data, the cluster they belong to, the cluster's location and the WCSS score.
2. A plot graph showing the data (non-red dots) and clusters (red dots).
3. A graph showing the "elbow" point that WCSS made.

Note: The WCSS graph and the WCSS score in the console will show up after closing the KMeans plot graph.
